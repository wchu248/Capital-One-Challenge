# Capital One Challenge

<b>Created By</b>: Winston Chu

This project was built for the Capital One Summer Summit 2017 and its purpose is to recommend restaurants to users based on their inputs to a simple questionnaire. It first finds the user's location by using HTML5 Geolocation and then queries the top 10 most relevant restaurants near the user, lists them out, and plots them on an interactive map.

This project is built on the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> framework and utilizes <a href="https://www.yelp.com/developers">Yelp's Fusion API</a> along with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/">Google Maps API</a>. It is written in HTML, Javascript/Jquery, and CSS (<a href="http://materializecss.com/">Materialize</a>).

This project is currently live on Heroku at: https://capital-one-challenge.herokuapp.com/
